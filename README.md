# Website-Tuinonderhoud-2008

Website for small gardener company, Leeuwarden, The Netherlands, 2008.
I made this website for my dad back in 2008 when he just started a second career as gardener after his retirement from the airforce.
I have had it hosted and maintained it between 2008-2016.

The website itself was orginally made in Adobe Dreamweaver.
I've adjusted it along the way with lightbox (image slideshow) and a PHP contactpage. Client and company gets a (confirmation)mail and the page has error/spamhandling .

HTML 4/ CSS/ Lightbox/ JS/ PHP
