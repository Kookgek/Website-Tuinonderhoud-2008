# Website-Tuinonderhoud-2008

Website for small gardener company, location Leeuwarden, The Netherlands, 2008
I made this website for my dad back in 2008 when he just started a second career as gardener after his retirement form the airforce.
I have had it hosted and maintained it between 2008-2016

The website itself was orginally made out of Adobe Dreamweaver and ive adjusted it along the way
with a slidebox and a PhP contactpage with errorhandling.
HTML 4/ CSS/ Slidebox/ JS/ PhP

All images, icons and texts are made by me.
